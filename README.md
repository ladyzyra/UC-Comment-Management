## Description

"UC Comment Management" is a plugin that makes it easy to manage the comments on your blog, especially for those of you who have a significant amount of comments.

Simply put, "UC Comment Management" introduces a new area in the administrative dashboard that allows you to see what comments to which you - as the site author - have not yet replied.

This project has been adopted from the WordPress Adopt Me program: https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/adopt-me/ and forked from pippinsplugins/Comments-Not-Replied-To. We are currently in development planning if you'd like to join the project above.

## Frequently Asked Questions

= Does this look at all my existing comments? =

At this point, no. That would cause issues on larger sites with upwards of 10,000 comments. We plan on introducing a method to handle this in the future.
